It's Raining Men
Humidity is rising
Barometer's getting low
According to our sources
The street's the place to go

'Cause tonight for the first time
Just about half past ten
For the first time in history
It's gonna start raining men

It's raining men
Hallelujah
It's raining men
Amen

It's raining men
Hallelujah
It's raining men
Amen

'Cause tonight for the first time
Just about half past ten
For the first time in history
It's gonna start raining men

It's raining men
Hallelujah
It's raining men
Amen

I'm gonna go out
I'm gonna let myself get
Absolutely soaking wet

It's raining men
Hallelujah
It's raining men
Every specimen

Tall, blonde, dark and lean
Rough and tough and strong and mean

God bless Mother Nature
She's a single woman too
She took over heaven
And she did what she had to do

She taught every angel
To rearrange the sky
So that each and every woman
Could find the perfect guy

It's raining men

Go get yourself wet, girl
I know you want to

I feel stormy weather moving in
About to begin
Hear the thunder
Don't you lose your head
Rip off the roof and stay in bed
(Rip off the roof and stay)

It's raining men
Hallelujah
It's raining men
Amen

It's raining men
Hallelujah
It's raining men
Amen

It's raining men
Hallelujah
It's raining men
Amen

It's raining men
Hallelujah
It's raining men
Amen

It's raining men
It's raining men
It's raining men
